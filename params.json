The tools we use include Java, Spring, MySQL, Tomcat, HTML/CSS and JS.\r\n\r\n# Project 1: Address Book\r\n[Link To Project](http://addressbook-piekarski.rhcloud.com/)<br/> \r\n[Source Code](https://github.com/JPiekarski/addressbook)<br/>\r\n<p>A simple CRUD application, this project lets a user see the addresses in the book and sort them. It also had an administrator role who can edit the existing addresses and add new addresses to the book.</p>    \r\n\r\n# Project 2: Triangle App\r\n[Source Code](https://github.com/JPiekarski/TriangleApp)<br/>\r\n<p>The application was designed to take in three values, either from a user or from a file, and determine what kind of triangle, if any, they formed.</p>\r\n<!--\r\n #Project 3: Flooring Order Tracker\r\n[Source Code]()<br/>\r\nThis project was created to demonstrate basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database. It uses MySQL, Java and the Spring Framework.-->\r\n\r\n# Group Project\r\n\r\n[Link To Project](http://rothlan.dynu.com/SWCManager/spring/login)<br/> \r\n[Source Code](https://github.com/dwyp/Projects/tree/master/SWCManager)<br/>\r\n\r\n<p>This project was created as a capstone project for the 12 week Java bootcamp at the Software Craftsmanship Guild. The application allows management and tracking of all students (potential, current and past), cohorts, hiring partners and employers and users of the application. This is a full stack application with a MySQL database, Java and Spring for the logic and controller, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front end.</p> \r\n<p>The project uses Spring Security to handle roles and logins, dynamically changing the view depending on permissions of the user. Two users have been set up, admin and view. The admin user has all permissions, while the view user can only view information. The passwords for both users are currently set to password. </p>\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
